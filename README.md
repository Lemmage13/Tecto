# Tecto
This will eventually be a tectonic plate simulator made in c# and unity.

The aim of this software is for worldbuilders to make realistic earth-like planets without the unnatural noisemap look.
Making the software in unity will provide a framework to interact with and visualise the model as it is being built.
